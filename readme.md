### Most of the points of interest in Version 3.6 have been updated (100% exploration, minerals, lizards, shrines, hilichurls, Naku Weed, Prism Shard), if there is any missing or omission, please dm 茶亭#6804 on Discord. 

I would like to clarify that most of the JSON files are not done by myself. As a primary school student, I do not have much time to record the points of interest. Most of them are collected from the Internet.
